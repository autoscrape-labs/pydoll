1. **Email**: Send details to [security@example.com] (replace with your actual security email)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab in this repository
3. **Private Disclosure**: Contact the maintainers directly through GitHub

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity (1-4 weeks)
- **Disclosure**: After fix is deployed

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Use exact version pinning for security-critical dependencies
   - Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities

2. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use type hints and static analysis tools
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Testing**
   - Include security test cases
   - Test for common web vulnerabilities
   - Use automated security scanning tools

### For Users

1. **Installation**
   - Always install from official sources (PyPI)
   - Verify package signatures when available
   - Use virtual environments

2. **Usage**
   - Keep PyDoll updated to the latest version
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Validate all user inputs in your applications

## Security Features

### Browser Security

- **Sandboxing**: PyDoll runs browsers in isolated environments
- **Network Controls**: Configurable network restrictions
- **File System Access**: Limited file system access controls

### Connection Security

- **TLS/SSL**: Secure connections to browser instances
- **Authentication**: Proper authentication mechanisms
- **Input Validation**: All protocol messages are validated

## Known Security Considerations

### Browser Security Context

PyDoll controls browser instances which have inherent security implications:

1. **Execution Context**: JavaScript code execution in controlled environments
2. **Network Access**: Browsers can make network requests
3. **File System**: Limited file system access through browser APIs

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Isolated Environments**: Run in containers or virtual machines when possible
2. **Network Policies**: Implement network restrictions
3. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate resource limits
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor browser activities

## Compliance

This project follows:

- **OWASP Guidelines**: Web application security best practices
- **NIST Framework**: Cybersecurity framework guidelines
- **Industry Standards**: Following established security standards
